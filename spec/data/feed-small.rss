			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of my apprenticeship, I asked for some general advice during a meeting on my first day. <a href="http://twitter.com/redsquirrel/">Dave Hoover</a> pointed out that the apprenticeship goes by very quickly so it&#8217;s a good idea to have short-term goals in mind.</p> 
<p>As Dave mentioned that, I thought a tool that would be perfect for capturing my thoughts on a daily basis and hopefully facilitate retrospection on my progress and growth. And that tool is <a href="http://mercuryapp.com/">MercuryApp</a>.</p> 
<p>I had previously used MercuryApp off and on to track variously things, but with no real goal in sight. With my apprenticeship, I want to be able to look back at a certain day or week and remember how I was feeling. What bugged me that day? What went great? Did I have any breakthroughs? Or perhaps a major headache? I hope MercuryApp helps me think back on my apprenticeship and make sure I am heading in the right direction. I&#8217;ve already found MercuryApp for my weekly checkin meetings.</p> 
<p>I am using another means to keep track of various technical revelations that come to me on a daily basis. Some of my most frustrating experiences are times when I know I&#8217;ve solved some problem in the past but cannot remember how I did it. My only real solution is to try to remember what day I figured this out in the past so I can review my browser history that day, because more than likely I found the answer online.</p> 
<p>To try to stop that from happening, I&#8217;ve started <a href="http://wiki.jonhoman.com/">a wiki</a> where I&#8217;m posting <a href="http://wiki.jonhoman.com/index.php?title=Learning_Notes">&#8220;Learning Notes&#8221;</a> so I can keep track of information that solved a problem or an article that I found particular interesting. I&#8217;m also writing down quotes or interesting tidbits from books I read, starting with <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book">The RSpec Book</a>.</p> 
<p>Here&#8217;s to using technology to bolster my memory!</p>
